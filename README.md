## DIT Games Engines 1 Assignment

### Assignment Proposal; Music Reactive Particle Generator

My plan for this project is to create a system that will produce generative smoke effects in rhythm with a song.

This project aims to produce a unity project that is much more similar to an audio visualiser than to a game.

An example of something similar to what this project hopes to achieve can be seen in the following video:

It is my hope that I will produce something in essence similar to this. I have more of an idea of different sound frequencies corresponding to different colours. I will also separate the colours of smoke or particle effects generated more than in the video so as to produce a more distinguishable effect for when the frequency is heard in the song.
