# DIT Games Engines 1 Assignment

## Assignment Demo; Audio Responsive Particle System

### Description
This repo holds my Unity project for Games Engines 1. It is a particle system that reacts to the audio that it is using. As the project exists now on this repo, it plays the song D by Truxton. This project will work with other songs, but for testing and demo purposes I have found that this song works quite well to show off the various frequency ranges that are used in an average song. Madeon's Finale is also included for the pruposes of seeing what a different song would loook like with the project.

The project makes use of particle systems. These systems are a great use in Unity and take a lot of the tough work out of having to design one's own systems for generating and cleaning up after particle emission. 

The system rotates slowly around the center of the scene. Particles are emitted as the songs frequency bands rise and fall in value. For the base and sub-bass (red particles in this project), I found that I had to boost the signal in order to get a noticable emission of particles. The entire scene is contained within a ball. There are also two other elements. A cube and a sphere rotating each other rotate around the scene. These two were added to give the sense of space as due to the rotation of these objects, they will appear sometimes in front of and some times behind the particles. This was added as the camera occasionally moves around (by design!), so these objects will give the viewer some grounding as to where they are in the scene occasionally. The cube also changes size with respect to the bass frequency.
